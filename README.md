- **Leave Management Automation**: Approval workflows, automated leave balance calculations, and real-time notifications for employees and managers.
- **Optimized Recruitment Management**: Allows for approval or rejection of applications, management of job postings, and centralization of candidate data.
- **Automated Payslip Generation**: Saves time and avoids errors related to manual calculations.
- **Training and Certification Management**: HR managers can invite employees to training programs, which they can accept or decline, with the ability to collect feedback.
- **Centralized HR Processes**: Provides a clear and structured overview for HR managers, employees, and candidates to streamline HR activities.
